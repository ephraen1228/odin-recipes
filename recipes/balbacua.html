        This Cebuano dish was inherited from the Spaniards a long time ago. But
        there are also other versions in other provinces like Cagayan de Oro,
        Bohol and Davao. Imagine, cooking a dish for almost a day makes you
        wonder what kind of dish that took so long to cook. The average cooking
        time for this dish is about seven hours. The name of this dish
        “balbacua” came from the Spanish word “barbacoa” which means cooking
        meat very slowly on an open fire for several hours. Maybe our ancestors
        named it balbacua because of the length of time involved in cooking.
        Just in case you can not find ox tail, which is very expensive compared
        to other parts of the cow, you can also use the combination of ox skin
        and beef ribs to simulate the ox tail which is mostly skin and bones and
        some fatty tissues.
