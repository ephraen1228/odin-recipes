        This dish is almost similar to a caldereta but the chicken liver is
        there and is not all in the sauce. This dish started as a trial dish
        just to enliven the liver and gizzard given to me but this is totally
        added to my menu now! I asked Therese to come over and taste the dish
        and she was really surprised that you can make chicken liver and gizzard
        as tasty as this dish.

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare and wash the chicken liver and gizzard. Transfer them to a
            bowl or container. Pour the lemon soda and soy sauce. Season with
            some black pepper and then mix well. Let this marinate for an hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat some oil in a pan. Add the garlic and onions and then saute for
            a few minutes until aromatic. Add the marinated chicken liver and
            gizzard until they turn light brown. Remove the chicken liver from
            the pan and transfer to a container. (To prevent overcooking the
            chicken liver). Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the reserved marinade. Cover the pan and let it simmer for a few
            minutes until the gizzard is tender. Once cooked, add the chicken
            liver back to the pan. Mix well until coated with the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the tomato sauce and stir a bit. Let it cook until the tomato
            sauce is absorbed by the liver.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the green peas and the red bell pepper. Mix well and saute.
          </li>
