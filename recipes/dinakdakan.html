        Dinakdakan or warek-warek is an Ilocano delicacy made with grilled pork
        parts such as the face, ears, liver, and tongue. It is traditionally
        served as a bar chow or pulutan to go with ice-cold beer but has evolved
        over the years into a hearty main dish enjoyed with piping-hot steamed
        rice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the Kapampangan sisig, the meat is first simmered in
        aromatics until tender, charred over hot coals, and cut into bite-sized
        strips before tossing in tangy calamansi or vinegar dressing with minced
        ginger, red onions, and chili peppers.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets this Ilocano delicacy apart from sisig is the addition of pig
        brain. It was simmered until cooked, mashed until smooth, and then
        stirred in as a final touch to add creaminess.

        <ol>
          <li>
            In a pot over medium heat, combine pork face, salt, peppercorns, bay
            leaves, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum
            that accumulates on top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or
            until meat is tender but not falling apart. With a slotted spoon,
            remove meat and drain well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add liver to the pot and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes or until
            half-done. Remove from pan and drain well.

          <li>
            Add pig brain to pot and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. With a
            slotted spoon, remove brain and transfer into a bowl. With a fork,
            mash until smooth. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Over hot coals, grill pork for about 4 to 6 minutes on each side or

            thinly
          </li>
          <li>
            Grill liver for about 3 to 5 minutes until nicely charred and fully
            cooked.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, combine pork meat, onions, ginger, and chili
            peppers.
